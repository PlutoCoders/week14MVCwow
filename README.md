Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog

In this assignment we are setting up a website where users can login, create posts, and everyone can comment on them.

## How to Use
- To use this application, first navigate to the login page, which can be accessed with the login button to the top right.
- From there, press the signup button at the bottom
- Enter your new account info, and press signup
- Now make your first post by filling in the title and content, then press create!
- You will see all your posts pasted below in the section that contains only your posts (this is your dashboard)
- To go to the main page, press the title on the header
- Here you will see all posts by other users!
- To delete your post, go back to your dashboard, and click on the post in your posts section.
- You can update or delete your post from here using the buttons at the bottom.
- Enjoy!
